<center><h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1></center>
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm in computer science that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.

Classes - a blueprint of an object
Objects - an instance of a class
Methods - methods represent behaviors
Attributes - information to be stored in a class about an object




<center><h1>Four Principles of OOP</h1></center>
The four pillars of object-oriented programming are:


Inheritance: child classes inherit data and behaviors from the parent class
Encapsulation: containing information in an object, exposing only selected information
Abstraction: only exposing high-level public methods for accessing an object
Polymorphism: many methods can do the same task
